# Bioinformatics Interactive Toolbox for Enrichment analysis

BITE Analysis Shiny app that provides a graphical interface to perform enrichment analysis for RNA-Seq gene sets (and associated values).

Bioinformatics Interactive Toolbox for Enrichment analysis, or BITE Analysis, is developed as an assignment in the 'Bioinformatics in omic sciences : genomic and transcriptomic analysis' subject area. This is a subject of the Master's degree in Bioinformatics, statistics and modeling done at the Rouen-Normandie University, France.
